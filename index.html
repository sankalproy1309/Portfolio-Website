        <h2>The Start: Falling in Love with Photography</h2>

          <p>
            It all began with a camera. I still remember the thrill of holding one for the first time, marveling at the
            ability to capture a fleeting moment and preserve it forever. Photography quickly became my escape, a way to
            express myself and tell stories without words. I was fascinated by how light, angles, and timing could turn
            ordinary scenes into extraordinary visuals.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            My initial attempts were simple: snapping pictures of sunsets, flowers, and candid portraits of friends and
            family. As I explored this art form, I dove into online tutorials, learning about composition, exposure, and
            editing. Each photograph taught me something new, and soon, my passion for capturing still moments evolved
            into an interest in motion.

      <div class="section videography">
        <h2>The Transition to Videography</h2>

          <video src="images/body/3rd section/videography.mp4" loop autoplay muted width="700px"></video>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            The shift from photography to videography was natural. If a picture could tell a story, a video could tell a
            chapter. I started experimenting with short clips, combining them into montages with simple transitions and
            music. Videography introduced me to the concept of storytelling on a broader canvas.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            As I improved, I began to document events, trips, and everyday life, turning mundane routines into cinematic
            sequences. I discovered how much impact a well-timed frame, a dramatic angle, or an emotional piece of
            background music could have on the audience. Videography wasn’t just about recording—it was about evoking
            emotions, and that realization pushed me toward video editing.

            Editing became my playground. I found immense satisfaction in piecing together raw footage to create
            something meaningful and impactful. Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve became my tools of choice, and
            hours spent tinkering with transitions, color grading, and audio mixing felt more like play than work.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            I honed my skills by editing travel vlogs, event recaps, and passion projects. Each project was an
            opportunity to experiment—whether it was mastering speed ramping, learning green-screen techniques, or
            creating seamless transitions. Editing transformed my creative process. It wasn’t just about shooting
            anymore; it was about crafting an experience.

            As I delved deeper into videography, travel became an inseparable part of my journey. Capturing new
            landscapes, cultures, and experiences expanded my perspective. Every trip was a treasure trove of
            inspiration, filled with stories waiting to be told.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            I traveled not just for the sake of exploring new places but also to create. I filmed bustling cityscapes,
            serene mountain ranges, and vibrant markets, blending my passion for storytelling with my love for
            adventure. Traveling taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of stepping out of my comfort
            zone—qualities that would later serve me well in my coding and entrepreneurial endeavors.

            While my love for visual storytelling grew, I found myself drawn to the digital tools that powered
            creativity. I wanted to understand the backend of the platforms I used every day—how they worked, how they
            were built, and how I could create my own. This curiosity led me to coding.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            Starting with HTML and CSS, I began building simple websites. The ability to bring ideas to life on a screen
            was exhilarating. I soon ventured into JavaScript, Python, and other programming languages, finding
            parallels between coding and the art forms I already loved. Both required creativity, problem-solving, and
            an eye for detail.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            As I progressed, I merged my creative and technical skills, building websites that showcased my photography
            and videography, and experimenting with interactive storytelling. Coding wasn’t just a skill; it became a
            new medium for expression.

            Now, I stand at the intersection of creativity, technology, and business. My journey has come full circle as
            I step into the entrepreneurial world. I’m building platforms and products that blend my passions—tools that
            empower others to create, explore, and share.

          <p>
            Entrepreneurship is teaching me a whole new set of skills—strategic thinking, leadership, and perseverance.
            It’s challenging but deeply fulfilling to see my ideas take shape and make an impact. Each step, from
            photography to coding to entrepreneurship, feels like a natural progression, each passion building on the
            last.
